## Detect Underlying Table in SAP
```
Hi,  my name is Ray Kim. I am here to share my experience in SAP automation. 
I am the furtherest thing from an expert but I hope my codes can help you.

```


## Before starting, I recommend that you prepare two things
### (1) Ensure your scripting is enabled on your SAP.

#### You might need to request your IT department to allow this.
### (2) Download Stefan Schnell's SAP Script Recorder.
#### SAP has a built-in recorder. But if you use that you will need to change the syntax to be used in Python.
#### Using Stefan's Recorder generates Python-friendly syntax along with many other powerful features.
